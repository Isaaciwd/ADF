#-------------------------------
#config_cam_baseline.yaml

#This is the main CAM diagnostics config file
#for doing comparisons of a CAM run against
#another CAM run, or a CAM baseline simulation.

#Currently, if one is on NCAR's Casper
#machine, then only the CAM model data
#paths, case names, and model year spans
#are needed.  Running this diagnostics on
#a different machine, or with a different model,
#may require additional modifications.
#--------------------------------

#This first set of variables specify basic info required by all diagnostic runs:
diag_basic_info:

  #Is this a model vs observations comparison?
  #If "false", then a model-model comparison is assumed:
  compare_obs: false

  #Location of observational climatologies (only matters if "compare_obs" is true):
  obs_climo_loc: /glade/work/brianpm/observations/climo_files

  #Name of CAM case (or CAM run name):
  cam_case_name: f.e21.FWscHIST_BCG.f09_f09_mg17_84L_80kmTop_tau_0_ubc_T.001

  #Location of CAM climatologies:
  cam_climo_loc: /glade/scratch/nusbaume/cam_diag_climo_files/f.e21.FWscHIST_BCG.f09_f09_mg17_84L_80kmTop_tau_0_ubc_T.001

  #Name of CAM baseline case (only matters if "compare_obs" is false):
  cam_baseline_case_name: f.e21.FWscHIST_BCG.f09_f09_mg17_110L.001

  #Location of baseline CAM cliimatologies (only matters if "compare_obs" is false):
  cam_baseline_climo_loc: /glade/scratch/nusbaume/cam_diag_climo_files/f.e21.FWscHIST_BCG.f09_f09_mg17_110L.001

  #Location where re-gridded CAM climatology files are stored:
  cam_regrid_loc: /glade/scratch/nusbaume/cam_diag_regrid_files

  #Overwrite CAM re-gridded files?
  #If false, then regridding will be skipped for regridded variables
  #that already exist in "cam_regrid_loc":
  cam_overwrite_regrid: false

  #Location where CAM diagnostic plots are stored:
  cam_diag_plot_loc: /glade/scratch/nusbaume/cam_diag_plots

#This second set of variables specify whether CAM climatologies need to be calculated:
diag_cam_climo:

  #Calculate cam climatologies?
  #If false, neither the climatology or time-series files will be created:
  calc_cam_climo: true

  #Overwrite CAM climatology files?
  #If false, then already existing climatology files will be skipped:
  cam_overwrite_climo: false

  #Location of CAM history (h0) files:
  cam_hist_loc: /glade/scratch/hannay/archive/f.e21.FWscHIST_BCG.f09_f09_mg17_84L_80kmTop_tau_0_ubc_T.001/atm/hist

  #model year when climatology should start:
  start_year: 1986

  #model year when diagnostics should end:
  end_year: 2005

  #Save interim time series files?
  #WARNING:  This can take up a significant amount of space:
  cam_ts_save: true

  #Overwrite time series files, if found?
  #If set to false, then time series creation will be skipped if files are found:
  cam_overwrite_ts: false

  #Location where time series files are (or will be) stored:
  cam_ts_loc: /glade/scratch/nusbaume/cam_diag_ts_files/f.e21.FWscHIST_BCG.f09_f09_mg17_84L_80kmTop_tau_0_ubc_T.001

#This third set of variables specify whether CAM baseline climatologies need to be calculated
#This only matters if "compare_obs" is false:
diag_cam_baseline_climo:

  #Calculate cam baseline climatologies?
  #If false, neither the climatology or time-series files will be created:
  calc_cam_climo: true

  #Overwrite CAM climatology files?
  #If false, then already existing climatology files will be skipped:
  cam_overwrite_climo: false

  #Location of CAM history (h0) files:
  cam_hist_loc: /glade/scratch/hannay/archive/f.e21.FWscHIST_BCG.f09_f09_mg17_110L.001/atm/hist

  #model year when climatology should start:
  start_year: 1986

  #model year when diagnostics should end:
  end_year: 2005

  #Save interim time series files for baseline run?
  #WARNING:  This can take up a significant amount of space:
  cam_ts_save: true

  #Overwrite baseline time series files, if found?
  #If set to false, then time series creation will be skipped if files are found:
