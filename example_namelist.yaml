#example_namelist.yaml

#This is an example CAM diagnostics namelist file,
#which includes examples of each type of allowed input,
#along with a short description of what the input does.

#Currently this file can be used directly to test the
#diagnostics on either the NCAR Cheyenne or Casper machines.
#Other systems will require slight modifications, which are
#labeled in the comments below.

#Good luck!
