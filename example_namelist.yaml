#example_namelist.yaml

#This is an example CAM diagnostics namelist file,
#which includes examples of each type of allowed input,
#along with a short description of what the input does.

#Currently this file can be used directly to test the
#diagnostics on either the NCAR Cheyenne or Casper machines.
#Other systems will require slight modifications, which are
#labeled in the comments below.

#Good luck!
#--------------------------------

#This first set of variables specify basic info required by all diagnostic runs:
diag_basic_info:
  #Is this a model vs observations comparison?
  #If "false", then a model-model comparison is assumed:
  compare_obs: true
  #Location of observational climatologies (only matters if "compare_obs" is true):
  #NOTE: How the observational data sets will be managed long-term needs to be discussed at some point!
  obs_climo_loc: /glade/work/brianpm/observations/climo_files
  #Location of CAM climatologies:
  cam_climo_loc: /glade/scratch/nusbaume/cam_diag_climo_files
  #Location of baseline CAM cliimatologies (only matters if "compare_obs" is false):
  cam_baseline_climo_loc: /some/where/you/want/to/have/it

#This second set of variables specify whether CAM climatologies need to be calculated:
diag_cam_climo:
  #Calculate cam climatologies?
  #If false, neither the climatology or time-series files will be created
  calc_cam_climo: true
  #Name of CAM case (or CAM run name):
  cam_case_name: f2000.v211.fv1d.trop.L42.1
  #Location of CAM history (h0) files:
  cam_hist_loc: /glade/scratch/jcaron/archive/f2000.v211.fv1d.trop.L42.1/atm/hist
  #model year when climatology should start:
  start_year: 2000
  #model year when diagnostics should end:
  end_year: 2010
  #Save interim time series files?
  #WARNING:  This can take up a significant amount of space:
  cam_ts_save: true
  #Overwrite time series files, if found?
  #If set to false, then time series creation will be skipped if files are found:
  cam_overwrite_ts: false
  #Location where time series files are (or will be) stored:
  cam_ts_loc: /glade/scratch/nusbaume/cam_diag_ts_files/f2000.v211.fv1d.trop.L42.1

#This third set of variables specify whether CAM baseline climatologies need to be calculated
#This only matters if "compare_obs" is false:
diag_cam_baseline_climo:
  #Calculate cam baseline climatologies?
  #If false, neither the climatology or time-series files will be created
  calc_cam_climo: false
  #Name of CAM baseline case (or CAM baseline run name):
  cam_case_name: best.cam_run-ever
  #Location of CAM history (h0) files:
  cam_hist_loc: /where/ever/you/want
  #model year when climatology should start:
  start_year: 1850
  #model year when diagnostics should end:
  end_year: 2100
  #Save interim time series files for baseline run?
  #WARNING:  This can take up a significant amount of space:
  cam_ts_save: false
  #Overwrite baseline time series files, if found?
  #If set to false, then time series creation will be skipped if files are found:
  cam_overwrite_ts: false
  #Location where time series files are (or will be) stored:
  cam_ts_loc: /another/location/on/computer
