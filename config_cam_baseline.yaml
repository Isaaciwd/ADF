#-------------------------------
#config_cam_baseline.yaml

#This is the main CAM diagnostics config file
#for doing comparisons of a CAM run against
#another CAM run, or a CAM baseline simulation.

#Currently, if one is on NCAR's Casper
#machine, then only the CAM model data
#paths, case names, and model year spans
#are needed.  Running this diagnostics on
#a different machine, or with a different model,
#may require additional modifications.
#--------------------------------

#This first set of variables specify basic info required by all diagnostic runs:
diag_basic_info:

  #Is this a model vs observations comparison?
  #If "false", then a model-model comparison is assumed:
  compare_obs: false

  #Generate HTML website (currently only matters for AMWG table):
  create_html: true

  #Location of observational climatologies (only matters if "compare_obs" is true):
  obs_climo_loc: /glade/work/brianpm/observations/climo_files

  #Name of CAM case (or CAM run name):
  cam_case_name: new_best.came-run

  #Location of CAM climatologies:
  cam_climo_loc: /some/where/you/want/to/have/it

  #Name of CAM baseline case (only matters if "compare_obs" is false):
  cam_baseline_case_name: best.cam_run-ever

  #Location of baseline CAM cliimatologies (only matters if "compare_obs" is false):
  cam_baseline_climo_loc: /some/where/else/you/want/to/have/it

  #Location where re-gridded CAM climatology files are stored:
  cam_regrid_loc: /any/directory/you/want

  #Overwrite CAM re-gridded files?
  #If false, then regridding will be skipped for regridded variables
  #that already exist in "cam_regrid_loc":
  cam_overwrite_regrid: false

  #Location where CAM diagnostic plots are stored:
  cam_diag_plot_loc: /any/other/directory/you/want


#This second set of variables specify whether CAM climatologies need to be calculated:
diag_cam_climo:

  #Calculate cam climatologies?
  #If false, neither the climatology or time-series files will be created:
  calc_cam_climo: true

  #Overwrite CAM climatology files?
  #If false, then already existing climatology files will be skipped:
  cam_overwrite_climo: false

  #Location of CAM history (h0) files:
  cam_hist_loc: /location/where/you/stored/model/outputs

  #model year when climatology should start:
  start_year: 1850

  #model year when diagnostics should end:
  end_year: 2100

  #Save interim time series files?
  #WARNING:  This can take up a significant amount of space:
  cam_ts_save: true

  #Overwrite time series files, if found?
  #If set to false, then time series creation will be skipped if files are found:
  cam_overwrite_ts: false

  #Location where time series files are (or will be) stored:
  cam_ts_loc: /some/big/storage/location/to/save/time/series


#This third set of variables specify whether CAM baseline climatologies need to be calculated
#This only matters if "compare_obs" is false:
diag_cam_baseline_climo:

  #Calculate cam baseline climatologies?
  #If false, neither the climatology or time-series files will be created:
  calc_cam_climo: true

  #Overwrite CAM climatology files?
  #If false, then already existing climatology files will be skipped:
  cam_overwrite_climo: false

  #Location of CAM history (h0) files:
  cam_hist_loc: /location/of/second/cam/run/output/or/baseline/data

  #model year when climatology should start:
  start_year: 1850

  #model year when diagnostics should end:
  end_year: 2100

  #Save interim time series files for baseline run?
  #WARNING:  This can take up a significant amount of space:
  cam_ts_save: true

  #Overwrite baseline time series files, if found?
  #If set to false, then time series creation will be skipped if files are found:
  cam_overwrite_ts: false

  #Location where time series files are (or will be) stored:
  cam_ts_loc: /another/big/storage/location/to/save/time/series
